Linux distributions can start and stop the graphical desktop in various ways. The exact method differs from distribution and among distribution versions. For the newer systemd-based distributions, the display manager is run as a service, you can stop the GUI desktop with the systemctl utility and most distributions will also work with the telinit command, as in:

$ sudo systemctl stop gdm (or sudo telinit 3)

and restart it (after logging into the console) with:

$ sudo systemctl start gdm (or sudo telinit 5)

On Ubuntu versions before 18.04 LTS, substitute lightdm for gdm.

Methods of bringing down the GUI:
student:/tmp> sudo systemctl stop gdm
student:/tmp> sudo systemctl stop lightdm
student:/tmp> sudo telinit 3
      
Methods of bringing the GUI back up:
student:/tmp> sudo systemctl start gdm
student:/tmp> sudo systemctl start lightdm
student:/tmp> sudo telinit 5
     
     An available text terminal will prompt for a username (with the string login:) and password. When typing your password, nothing is displayed on the terminal (not even a * to indicate that you typed in something), to prevent others from seeing your password. After you have logged into the system, you can perform basic operations.

Once your session is started (either by logging into a text terminal or via a graphical terminal program), you can also connect and log into remote systems by using Secure SHell (SSH). For example, by typing ssh student@remote-server.com, SSH would connect securely to the remote machine (remote-server.com) and give student a command line terminal window, using either a password (as with regular logins) or cryptographic key to sign in without providing a password to verify the identity.
